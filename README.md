# üìä Price Monitoring Dashboard: Market vs Procurement Prices

## üßæ Task Description

This query compares **internal marketplace prices** with **external market prices** parsed from third-party websites.

The goal is to:
- Identify price discrepancies between the internal system and external sources.
- Detect anomalies ("outliers") where internal prices are significantly higher or lower than market ones.
- Provide actionable insights for procurement optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- **Main Data Sources:**
  - `order_service.order_item`: internal order data with actual prices paid
  - `price_parsing`: scraped prices from external sites
  - Dictionary tables (`pim_catalog_model_dict`, `client_service_business_entities_dict`, etc.)

- **Key Features Used:**
  - Common Table Expressions (`WITH`)
  - Date filtering using `today()`
  - `ROW_NUMBER()` to select the lowest price per model/region
  - `dictGet()` for dictionary-based lookups
  - Conditional classification (`CASE WHEN`) for business rules
  - Parameterized filters (for BI integration)
